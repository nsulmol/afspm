* Justification
** SPM Basics
In Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), an *atomically-sharp tip* is *scanned* above a *surface*, while *measuring* one or more *properties* gleaned from this tip.
#+beamer:\medskip

This process allows *atomic-level imaging* of properties, spectroscopic analysis, and even manipulation of a sample (toward *atomic-scale manufacturing*).

*** Description :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.55
:END:
In a traditional SPM experiment, a researcher with domain knowledge will:
1. *Prepare the system*: including defining the SPM mode (e.g. FM-AFM).
2. *Run the experiment*: monitoring collected scans, deciding on next scans, and updating any aspects of the experiment.
3. *Finalize the experiment*: by undoing any experiment-specific setup needed to run.

/Running the experiment is often *long*, and requires *constant* researcher *attention*./

** System Scripting and Code Reuse
*** Description :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.55
:END:
Many SPM systems allow custom scripts to run an experiment.

#+beamer:\medskip
However:
- Scripts written for a *specific* SPM system *cannot be re-used* for other SPM systems: different API/language constraints.
- While *decoupling* of SPM device and experiment logic *is possible*, it is *rarely* a *priority* for researchers.

* Introduction to afspm
** Goals and Scope
*** Goals
- *Clear Decoupling*: of SPM device specifics from the desired experiment; to allow reuse of a given experiment on multiple devices.
- *Multi-Language Support*: for integration with SPM devices; we should not be the limiting factor to integration.
- *Pausable Automation*: to allow a researcher to take over.
- *Separable on Multiple Devices*: composed of concise, separable components.
*** Scope
afspm will concern itself *only* with automation of high-level, low-frequency decisions a researcher would perform *during* an experiment.

** High-Level Design

*afspm* is designed around 'computation' components that correspond to nodes in a network. An experiment contains:
- *Device Controller*: abstract - specifies the required methods to communicate with an SPM device. Each SPM device will have its own DeviceController implementation.
- *Afspm Controller*: mediates control of the SPM device (only 1 component in control at a time).
- *Afspm Components*: the one or more components the user requires to run their experiment.
** Communication Protocol

*afspm* uses ZeroMQ as its communications/concurrency framework and protobuffers as its serialization layer. Both are cross-platform and cross-language.
***** What is ZeroMQ?
Library that abstracts away protocols used, allowing easy switching of how 'nodes' communicate in a system.
***** What are protobuffers?
Library for serializing structured data (translating a data structure into a format that can be stored/communicated).

* Design Particulars
** I/O Paths
*** Publisher-Subscriber Path
- The DeviceController *publishes* ScanState, ScanParameters, and Scan *changes*.
- These are passed on by the AfspmController. Data is *stored* in a *cache* and resent to new/crashed components.
- Each component choose what aspects to *subscribe* to, and receives data from these.
*** Control Path
- Each component can send *control requests* over its client.
- The AfspmController determines which *client* is *in-control*, and *forwards* these to the DeviceController.
- The DeviceController *receives* control requests from one client and *responds*.

** afspm Controller
*** Cache Logic
Data is *stored* into the *cache* according to a *user-defined configuration*.

#+beamer:\medskip
These map a *protobuf Message* to a *cache key* (envelope), and vice-versa.
*** Experiment Problems
Any component can *report* experiment *problems*, indicating issues that should cause the experiment to *pause* until *resolved*, and can *remove* these problems.

#+beamer:\medskip
This allows, e.g., detecting a tip crash and attempting to correct it.

*** Control Modes
The AfspmController defines the *control mode*, which can be:
- *Automated*: default, automation runs.
- *Manual*: pause automation.
- *Problem*: experiment problems are logged, pause automation.
** The Config File
*** Description :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.6
:END:
afspm uses a *single* TOML *configuration file* per experiment.

#+beamer:\medskip
Within this file, a user defines:
- The communication protocols used between components.
- Common variables passed between components (e.g. how big the scan size will be).
- The components to spawn.

#+beamer:\medskip
Top-level definitions can function as *variables*: any *references* deeper in the config are *replaced* by them. This should *minimize* *repeating* oneself.

[[./images/config_toml.png]]



** Spawning the Experiment
*** Distributed Computing
Components can be *split up* among devices; on startup, the components to spawn can be specified.

*** Component Monitoring
All spawned components are *monitored*:
- Each sends *heartbeats* at a regular cadence.
- If one *stops* beating, it is *restarted*.

This should minimize a crash breaking experiments.
